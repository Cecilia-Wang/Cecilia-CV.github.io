## Our Land and Water

Land and water are the most valuable sources. In New Zealand, agriculture is dominanted by large pasture farms with large quantities of ruminant animals. Although everything looks natural and green, pasture farms and the ruminants over time,can result in undesirable environmental outcomes, especially in a long term. 

Ruminant animals such as cows produce large quantities of CH<sub>4</sub> gas, a major greenhouse gas second to CO<sub>2</sub>, contributing to climate changes. Apart from emitting greenhouse gas, ruminants also introduce excessive nitrogen to the local ground and the nearby water sources, potentially damaging the soil ecosystem and causing water eutrophication. 

The goal of the OLW project was to improve the land sustainabilities base on a comprehensive understanding of the ecological processes and the associated underlying mechanisms.

My involvement in OLW projects was to understand microbiomes across farm niches and their interactions, based on amplicon and omics data. In addition, by introducing a distrubance (urea) to soils, we would be able to test if and how the neighbourhood microbiomes respond to disturbances in soils. A manuscript was drafted (in review), titled "Soil Nitrogen Treatment Alters Microbiome Networks Across Farm Niches".

## Alternative Hydrogen Sinks in the Rumen Environment
Livestock farming is a vital part of agriculture that has significant environmental impacts. According to  [Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use),  total of 77% of agricultural land is allocated to livestock, accounting for 37% of the global protein supply ![land use](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/01/Global-land-use-graphic-1536x971.png)
