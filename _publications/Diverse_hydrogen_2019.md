**Abstract**

Farmed ruminants are the largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions globally. The methanogenic archaea
responsible for these emissions use molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), produced during bacterial and eukaryotic carbohydrate
fermentation, as their primary energy source. In this work, we used comparative genomic, metatranscriptomic and
co-culture-based approaches to gain a system-wide understanding of the organisms and pathways responsible for ruminal H<sub>2</sub>
metabolism. Two-thirds of sequenced rumen bacterial and archaeal genomes encode enzymes that catalyse H2 production or
consumption, including 26 distinct hydrogenase subgroups. Metatranscriptomic analysis confirmed that these hydrogenases
are differentially expressed in sheep rumen. Electron-bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenases from carbohydrate-fermenting
Clostridia (e.g., _Ruminococcus_) accounted for half of all hydrogenase transcripts. Various H<sub>2</sub> uptake pathways were also
expressed, including methanogenesis (_Methanobrevibacter_), fumarate and nitrite reduction (_Selenomonas_), and acetogenesis
(Blautia). Whereas methanogenesis-related transcripts predominated in high methane yield sheep, alternative uptake
pathways were significantly upregulated in low methane yield sheep. Complementing these findings, we observed significant
differential expression and activity of the hydrogenases of the hydrogenogenic cellulose fermenter _Ruminococcus_ albus and
the hydrogenotrophic fumarate reducer _Wolinella succinogenes_ in co-culture compared with pure culture. We conclude that
H<sub>2</sub> metabolism is a more complex and widespread trait among rumen microorganisms than previously recognised. There is
evidence that alternative hydrogenotrophs, including acetogenic and respiratory bacteria, can prosper in the rumen and
effectively compete with methanogens for H<sub>2</sub>. These findings may help to inform ongoing strategies to mitigate methane
emissions by increasing flux through alternative H2 uptake pathways, including through animal selection, dietary
supplementation and methanogenesis inhibitors.
